# iPhone-Sales-Analysis

**ðŸš€ iPhone Sales Analysis using Python ðŸ“Š** 

Apple iPhones remain among the top-selling smartphones worldwide, despite the fierce competition from brands offering the latest technology at lower prices in markets like India. This inspired me to dive into the sales patterns of iPhones in India, focusing on Flipkart sales data. 

I recently completed a detailed **iPhone Sales Analysis** project using Python, where I explored key sales trends, customer preferences, and the market impact of iPhones in India. For this project, I used data collected from Kaggle, which provided insights into the online retail performance of iPhones.

Hereâ€™s a quick overview of what I did:
- Collected and cleaned the dataset from Kaggle
- Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify trends and patterns
- Visualized sales performance over time using various data visualization techniques
- Derived actionable insights on customer behavior and market trends

This project was a fantastic opportunity to apply my data analysis skills using Python and create meaningful visualizations.
